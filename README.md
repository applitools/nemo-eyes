# nemo-eyes
A [nemo](https://github.com/paypal/nemo) plugin for automated visual testing using [Applitools Eyes](https://applitools.com/).

### Installation

1. Add dependencies to package.json and install.

```javascript
	...
    "nemo": "^1.0.0",
    "nemo-eyes": "^0.0.4",
	...
```

2. Add `nemo-eyes` plugin to your nemo config JSON object. Also note `eyes` section under `data`

```javascript
{
  "driver": {
    ...
  },
  "plugins": {
    "view": {
      "module": "nemo-eyes"
    }
  },
  "data": {
    ...
     "eyes" : {
          "apiKey" : "yourAPIKey",      /* Required,  */
          "width" : 800,                /* Required, format - Number */
          "height" : 600,               /* Required, format - Number */
          "log" : true,                 /* Optional */
          "fullPageScreenShot" : true   /* Optional */
     }
  }
}
```

Note `fullPageScreenShot` option in `eyes` configuration above. Safari and Chrome take only 'viewport' screenshots and not full page screenshots.If you set `fullPageScreenShot` to `true`, AppliTools takes full page screenshots for safari and chrome for you to visually compare pages. IE and Firefox drivers do take full page screenshots.

### How to use
Once nemo-eyes plugin is registered, `eyes` namespace will be attached to `nemo` and methods for visual testing are exposed. Idea is to,

1. Initialize your application and test using `nemo.eyes.open('Sample Application','Homepage test');`
2. Trigger a visual check using `nemo.eyes.checkWindow("PayPal Home Page");`.
If base image for the window in question is present, new screenshot will be compared against it. Otherwise new screenshot will be saved as a base image
3. Close test and resolved promise will have corresponding results
```javascript
    nemo.eyes.close().then( function(testResults){
        console.log(testResults.isPassed);
        console.log(testResults.url);
    });
```
